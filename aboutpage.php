              <h1>Meet The Owners</h1>
              <p> Two friends found their passion intertwining with nature's beauty, embarking on a colourful journey as florists. 
                Hi, we are Hazel & Mary, Mary & Hazel. We share an ardent love for flowers and all things botanical. Our passion for artistry and a desire to make any space more beautiful with flowers brought us together on an unexpected path. 
                Fleur Loca began when we had the privilege of being asked to do the flowers for a friend’s daughter’s wedding.  We discovered a mutual admiration for the art of floral design, recognizing the power of blossoms to add charm to life's most precious moments.
                Driven by this shared passion, we decided to turn our love for flowers into a flourishing business, with our combined talents and creativity plus the essential LOCA personas with boundless enthusiasm and vision to craft stunning floral arrangements for any occasion. 
                Weddings are our favorite. We set out to not only create stunning floral designs but also to tell the unique love stories of each couple we have the honor of serving. Making every wedding a cherished and truly unforgettable affair. We embark on this adventure, ready to bring joy and beauty to couples celebrating their love.</p>
